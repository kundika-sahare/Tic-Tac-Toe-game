# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using [ HTML  , CSS  , and JAVASCRIPT ]. The game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (either 'X' or 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
